## [My](https://exercism.io/profiles/lotharschulz) [exercism rust](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/) track solutions

I use this repository also to experiment with AI/LLM prompts to solve the exercises.

### model GPT 5

#### Context

I exclusively used GitHub Issues for this project. The workflow began with implementing the [Implement Wordy Exercise](https://github.com/lotharschulz/exercism-rust/issues/1). During this implementation, the Copilot agent detected that no Copilot instructions were present in the repository and flagged this through a [PR comment](https://github.com/lotharschulz/exercism-rust/pull/2#issuecomment-3261479075). This discovery prompted me to set up Copilot instructions as a separate issue: [âœ¨ Set up Copilot instructions](https://github.com/lotharschulz/exercism-rust/issues/3).
With the Copilot instructions now in place, I proceeded to implement the [implement custom-set exercise](https://github.com/lotharschulz/exercism-rust/issues/5). Interestingly, the Exercism tests and instructions were already so comprehensive and well-structured that adding Copilot instructions didn't yield a significantly improved development experience compared to the initial Wordy Exercise implementation. The quality of the existing Exercism framework proved to be the dominant factor in both cases.

## [Cursor IDE](docs.cursor.com)

Cursor IDE successfully solved the [accumulate](https://github.com/lotharschulz/exercism-rust/tree/main/accumulate) exercise using its agent mode with the following structured prompt:

```
# Code Implementation

Implement all _instructions_ defined in `accumulate/README.md` in the rust file:`accumulate/src/lib.rs`.

## Enable all tests
Ensure all tests in the `accumulate/tests` folder are NOT ignored and enabled. 

## Test the code

Run all tests in the `accumulate/tests` folder, after the implementation of the all _instructions_ in `accumulate/src/lib.rs` is done.


## Ensure all tests pass

Make sure all tests pass successfully. 
In case test(s) fail, adapt the code implementation and rerun all tests until all tests pass.

## Improve

Do better. Improve the code implementation and increase readability and reduce code complexity.
```

The result worked and was good code. Cursor ran multiple commands (`cargo` and others) and as a user, I had to confirm every of the requested commands.

#### Execution Process
Cursor's agent mode performed the following steps autonomously:

- Analyzed the exercise requirements from README.md
- Generated the implementation plan
- Implemented the solution in src/lib.rs
- Enabled all tests by removing #[ignore] attributes
- Executed cargo test to verify the solution
- Refactored the code for improved readability
- Re-tested to ensure refactoring didn't break functionality

#### User Interaction

- Approval Required: Each command execution (cargo test, file modifications) required user confirmation
- Transparency: All planned changes were shown before execution
- Control: User maintained full control over the process

## [Gemini CLI](https://blog.google/technology/developers/introducing-gemini-cli-open-source-ai-agent/)

Gemini cli is a terminal coding assitant that can solve exercism exercises: [https://www.lotharschulz.info/2025/06/25/getting-started-with-google-gemini-cli-complete-setup-guide-and-rust-testing-experience/](https://www.lotharschulz.info/2025/06/25/getting-started-with-google-gemini-cli-complete-setup-guide-and-rust-testing-experience/)

### model: GPT 4.1

##### Context

- exercism exercise folder

##### Prompt

```
Implement all TODOs in 'src/lib.rs'.
Ensure all tests in the 'tests' folder are NOT ignored and enabled. 
After the implementation of the all TODOs in 'src/lib.rs', run the tests in the 'tests' folder.
Make sure all tests in the 'tests' folder pass successfully. 
In case tests fail, adapt the implementation and continue with running tests and subsequent code implementation in case tests fail until all tests pass.
```
