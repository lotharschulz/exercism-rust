I use this also to experiment with prompts to solve the tasks

## [copilot edits](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-edits)

#### model: GPT 4o

The following prompt in:

```
Make also sure that all tests in 'tests' folder are active - no tests ignored. Implement the todos in libr.rs. When implementing make sure all tests in 'tests' folder pass succesfully. 
```

created all changes for [df4e27c](https://github.com/lotharschulz/exercism-rust/commit/df4e27c10cff8a3e650e3c853c51bf72b58b65b0) that pass all tests.

#### model: Gemini 2.0 Flash (Preview)

So far I could not come up with a prompt that can producs a similar implementation as GPT 4o above.
