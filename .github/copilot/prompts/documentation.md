# Documentation Enhancement Prompt

Improve inline documentation and external README clarity for this exercise.

## Steps
1. Ensure each public function has a concise doc comment explaining purpose, inputs, outputs, and edge cases.
2. Add examples with `/// # Examples` where illustrative.
3. If algorithm is non-trivial, include a brief rationale section.
4. Update (or create) exercise README from template if missing.
5. Ensure docs compile: `cargo doc --no-deps` (optional step if enabled in workflow).

## Style
- Write in clear, active voice.
- Keep examples minimal but representative.
- Avoid restating obvious implementation details.

## Output
List updated symbols + any newly added sections.
