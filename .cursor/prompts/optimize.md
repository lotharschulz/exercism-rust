# Optimize Current Solution

Analyze and optimize the current implementation:

## Optimization Goals
1. Improve time complexity
2. Reduce memory allocations
3. Enhance readability
4. Maintain correctness

## Steps
1. Benchmark current implementation
2. Identify bottlenecks
3. Apply Rust performance idioms
4. Verify tests still pass
5. Document improvements

## Techniques to Consider
- Replace loops with iterators
- Use zero-cost abstractions
- Pre-allocate collections
- Avoid unnecessary cloning
- Use const generics where applicable
- Consider SIMD operations
- Leverage compiler optimizations

Provide before/after performance comparison.
